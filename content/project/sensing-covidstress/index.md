The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the daily lives of individuals worldwide, contributing to significant increases in life stress. Individuals with mental health disorders are known to be at risk for worsening
of symptoms and functioning during periods of increased stress, making vulnerable during the COVID-19 pandemic. Identifying predictors of stress aleviation or exacerbation would, therefore, provide important 
insight into the role of stress development, and provide targets for delivery of just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAIs) targeting stress management. This is especially true for indivudals most vulnerable 
to the effects of life stress, such as those with major depressive disorder (MDD). Therefore, passive sensing data from participants diagnosed with MDD will be used to identify features extracted from mobile 
phone usage in attempt to predict trajectories of COVID-19-related life stress. Traditional machine learning and deep learning models will be compared and the features most strongly related to COVID-19-related 
life stress will be identified.
