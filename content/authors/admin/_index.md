Dr. Mackin’s research has used a wide range of methods to study the development and course of depression and anxiety. He has investigated how factors such as reinforcement learning, reward processing, life stress, and personality influence internalizing disorders longitudinally. He has also developed measures assessing subtypes of Major Depressive Disorder.
{style="text-align: justify;"}
Most recently, Dr. Mackin’s research has focused on applying machine learning techniques to passive sensor data from smartphones and wearable devices to better assess and predict real-time fluctuations in depressive symptoms and functioning. He is also interested in developing and implementing personalized just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAIs).
