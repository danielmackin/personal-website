abstract: "**Background.** The effect of life stress on suicidal symptoms during adolescence is well documented. Stressful life events
  can trigger suicidality, but most adolescents are resilient and it is unclear which factors protect against the deleterious
  impact of stress. Social support is thought to be one such factor. Therefore, we investigated the buffering effect of specific
  sources of social support (parental and peer) on life stress (interpersonal and non-interpersonal) in predicting suicidal
  symptoms during adolescence. In order to test the specificity of this stress buffering, we also examined it with regard
  to dysphoric mood.

  **Method.** Data come from the Adolescent Development of Emotions and Personality Traits (ADEPT) Project, a cohort of
  550 adolescent females aged 13.5â€“15.5 recruited from Long Island. Self-reported social support, suicidality, and dysphoria
  were assessed at baseline and suicidality and dysphoria were assessed again at 9-month follow-up. Life stress
  was assessed by interview at the follow-up.

  **Results.** High levels of parental support protected adolescent girls from developing suicidal symptoms following a stressor.
  This effect was less pronounced for peer support. Also, social support did not buffer the pathogenic effects of noninterpersonal
  stress. Finally, social support did not buffer the effect of life stress on dysphoric symptoms.

  **Conclusions.** Altogether, our results highlight a distinct developmental pathway for the development of suicidal symptoms
  involving parental support that differs from the development of dysphoria, and signifies the importance and specificity
  of social support in protecting against suicidality in adolescent girls."
