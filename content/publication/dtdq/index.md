abstract: "It has recently been recommended that treatment resistant depression be reconceptualized and renamed as
  difficult to treat depression (DTD). A consensus statement by an expert panel identified multiple variables
  associated with DTD and emphasized the importance of conducting a comprehensive evaluation of patients to
  identify predictors of inadequate treatment response. For practical reasons, it would be desirable to develop a
  self-report scale that can be incorporated into clinical practice that identifies patient, clinical, and treatment risk
  factors for DTD. Nine hundred twenty depressed patients completed the Difficult to Treat Depression Questionnaire
  (DTDQ). A subset of patients completed the scale a second time and completed the Remission from
  Depression Questionnaire at admission and discharge from a partial hospital program.
  
  The DTDQ demonstrated excellent internal consistency and test-retest reliability. Both the total DTDQ and the
  number of prior failed medication trials, the metric primarily relied upon to classify treatment resistant
  depression, predicted outcome. However, the DTDQ continued to be significantly associated with outcome after
  controlling for the number of failed trials, whereas the number of failed trials did not predict outcome after
  controlling for DTDQ scores. The DTDQ is a reliable and valid measure of the recently discussed concept of DTD."
