abstract: "Few investigations have directly compared personality and internalizing symptoms stability within the same
  sample and have not included personality facets. This study examined rank-order stability and mean-level change
  of Big Five domains, facets of neuroticism and extraversion, and internalizing symptoms in a sample of 550
  adolescent females. Personality and symptoms were assessed every nine months for three years. Three year rankorder
  stability was higher for personality domains and facets compared to symptoms. Notable exceptions
  included lower stability of depressivity and positive emotionality facets. Facets and symptoms showed similar
  mean level change. Overall, we observed modest and variable temporal differences between symptoms and traits;
  symptoms exhibited high rank-order stability and low mean-level change, but domains and facets were generally
  more stable."
