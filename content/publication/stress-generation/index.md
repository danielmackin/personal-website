abstract: "Blunted reward sensitivity and life stress are each depressogenic. Additionally, individuals with clinical
  and psychosocial vulnerabilities are prone to experience or evoke dependent life stressors (e.g., interpersonal
  conflict) that, in turn, increase depression risk. However, no previous study has investigated the
  role of neural vulnerability factors in generating life stress. Therefore, the current study investigated
  whether a neural measure of reward sensitivity prospectively predicts the generation of life stress, which
  in turn mediates effects of these neural processes on subsequent depression. Participants were 467
  never-depressed adolescent girls. Using event-related potentials, neural sensitivity to the difference
  between monetary reward and loss (the Reward Positivity [RewP]) was assessed at baseline. Negative life
  events were assessed twice via interview over the ensuing 18 months, yielding an index of total life stress
  over the follow-up period. A self-report dimensional measure of depression symptoms was administered
  at baseline and follow-up. After accounting for baseline age, depression, and race, a blunted RewP
  predicted greater dependent, but not independent, life stress over the follow-up. Mediation analyses
  revealed a significant indirect effect of the RewP on follow-up depression through dependent, but not
  independent, life stress. Our results suggest that neural processing reward and loss plays a crucial role in
  depressogenic stress generation."
